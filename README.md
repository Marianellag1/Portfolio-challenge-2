## **Description of the Project**
This portfolio can be viewed by anyone. It contains projects that I have created, as well as activities that I am very proud of and want to show off to future employers.



## **Installation**
A link is provided so that viewer can see the page live.



## **Usage Information**
User will be able to click on an image or link and they would be either taken to a project if image is clicked , or link, such as email, will be taken to an email portal.



## **Contribution Guidelines**
As this is more of a personal project, any advice to make it more user-friendly and look presentable, will be greatly appreciated. The contribution could then be added and give credit to person.



## **Test Instructions**
A live link will be provided at the top of the  README and user can simply click, and will be sent to the live portfolio. The majority of the page has a link. When hovered over navbar menu, a 'title' will show indicating the user what they will be clicking. Links in work, which in the future will contain actual projects, take the user to a new page/tab, allowing the user to still continue to keep the original profile. Email and Github accounts, when clicked, will send user to those pages.
